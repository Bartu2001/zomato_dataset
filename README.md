# zomato_dataset      Data-Analysis
Hello,Today, I would like to share a dataset with you that I previously used for SQL queries and analyses on BigQuery.
In this dataset, I conducted data analysis and visualization using Python queries in Jupyter Notebook.
If you have prior experience in data analysis, understanding this dataset and its logic might be easier;
however, due to repetitive data, deciphering and comprehending the logic can sometimes be challenging.
Once you grasp the logic of data analysis, you can examine this dataset, follow the codes, and understand how they work.
I've provided explanations for each step. By downloading it in CSV format, you can use it for your own work or build upon it to perform new analyses.
Wishing you success in your endeavors.
